# Claude Cookbooks Project

## Project Purpose
Precision-engineered information processing project for context engineering tools. Curates refined knowledge to build effective context management systems for Claude Code CLI automation.

## Project Overview
Collection of practical examples and best practices for using Claude Code CLI, with focus on automation, context management, and effective prompt engineering.

## Documentation Guidelines
@context/memory/index.md
@context/memory/memory-hierarchy.md
@context/memory/memory-features.md
@context/memory/context-reference-guide.md

Complete memory system documentation including hierarchy, features, and writing format standards for all project documentation.

### Documentation Structure Rules
- **reference.md**: Centralized collection of all external markdown links and documentation references
- **index.md**: Context connection hub using `@` imports to load relevant documentation into Claude's context
- **Content files**: Pure content only - no external links to referenced source material

## Project Structure
- `/context` - Curated protocols, mechanisms, and best practices that Claude Code directly utilizes. Contains refined knowledge about memory systems, headless automation, hooks, agents, output styles, and MCP configuration.
- Root cookbooks - Practical examples and tutorials
