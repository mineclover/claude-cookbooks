# Extended Thinking

## Overview
Extended thinking mode provides enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks with step-by-step thought process transparency.

## When to Use
- Complex tasks: math, coding, analysis
- Multi-step problem solving
- Tasks requiring deep reasoning

## Best Practices

### Prompt Structure
- Request explicit thinking output in your prompt
- Allow space for step-by-step reasoning
- Include complete thinking blocks for continuity

### When to Request Extended Thinking
- Tasks requiring deep analysis
- Multi-step problem solving
- Complex reasoning chains
- Debugging and error analysis

### Guiding the Thinking Process
Include instructions like:
- "Think through this step-by-step"
- "Show your reasoning process"
- "Break down the problem systematically"

### Review and Learn
- Examine thinking blocks to understand reasoning
- Identify where logic succeeds or fails
- Refine prompts based on thinking patterns
